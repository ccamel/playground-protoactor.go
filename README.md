## Introduction

I have a deep-rooted passion for the Actor Model. Having been a big fan and an avid admirer of the [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org) Actor system, its elegance, and efficiency in managing concurrent processes, I've always been intrigued by the power and simplicity it offers.

[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org)'s approach to concurrency, fault tolerance, and system distribution has set a high standard in the realm of Actor-based systems. Drawing inspiration from this, I've created this repository as an experimentation to explore these compelling concepts in a different landscape - the world of Go. It's a personal quest to understand how the robustness and versatility of the Actor Model can be harnessed in Go.

If you're new to the Actor Model, take a moment to read about its theory. This project isn't just about understanding the theory; it's about diving into how to use it effectively and why it's a valuable tool in building concurrent systems.
